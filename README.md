Tutorial on how to use thermal_parser and exiftool to convert DJI radiometric JPG (R-JPG) to TIF with temp values and append GPS metadata

*** for Windows PC only, need to install Anaconda prior (https://www.anaconda.com/) ***

Follow these steps to batch process all R-JPG in a folder and output converted TIF files with same base name in the same folder:

1. Clone this repository to your computer and unzip it

2. Move the file called exiftool.exe to a folder that is listed in your PATH variable such as 'C:/Windows'

3. Open the Anaconda terminal and create a new python 3.6 environment using: `conda create -n thermal_env python=3.6 gdal numpy matplotlib -y`

4. Activate the new environment using: `conda acivate thermal_env`

5. Move any R-JPG images to be converted into the 'images' folder. (There is a sample H20-T image provided called 'DJI_0002_T.JPG')

6. In the anaconda terminal, navigate to the folder that contains the python scripts 'thermal.py' and 'tir_convert.py' as well as the 'images' and 'plugins' directories

7. Process the images using: `python tir_convert.py`

8. Find the converted images in the same folder as the inputs with the same root names and the '.tif' file extension
